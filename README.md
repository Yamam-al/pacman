## Initial Considerations for the pac-man agent

To implement a rule-based behavior for PacMan that aims to maximize the score by collecting all pellets while avoiding ghosts, the following strategic considerations have been developed:

### üü° Pellet-Seeking Behavior

- **Rule 1: Prioritize the nearest regular pellet unless danger is imminent.**
  Efficient pellet collection is the main source of points and helps complete the level more quickly.

- **Rule 2: Prefer pellets located in areas with a high concentration of other pellets.**
  Staying in high-density zones reduces unnecessary movement and increases overall efficiency.

### üî¥ Ghost Avoidance

- **Rule 3: Avoid tiles within a defined danger radius of non-edible ghosts if the ghost is nearer to the Tile as the Agent.**
  PacMan must maintain a safe distance to avoid being caught.

- **Rule 4: If a ghost is approaching, retreat to the safest available tile.**
  This fallback behavior improves PacMan‚Äôs chances of survival in critical situations.

### üî∑ Power Pellet Strategy

- **Rule 5: Move toward a power pellet if a ghost is nearby.**
  This allows PacMan to escape danger and potentially reverse the situation.

- **Rule 6: When powered up, actively chase and eat the nearest edible ghost ‚Äî but only if more than two power pellets remain on the map.**
  This ensures that PacMan uses power pellets strategically: If there are only two left, he focuses on collecting regular pellets instead of chasing ghosts, preserving power pellets for dangerous or tactical moments.
  
- **Rule 7: If powered up but no ghost is nearby, continue collecting pellets efficiently.**
  This maximizes score during the powered-up state while remaining alert to ghost respawns.

### üîÅ Exploration Fallback

- **Rule 8: If no pellets or power pellets are currently visible, explore the least-visited areas.**
  This promotes full map coverage and helps reveal any remaining pellets.

### üìä Rule Prioritization (Decision Hierarchy)

1. **Powered up** and **‚â§‚ÄØ2 power pellets used**? ‚Üí **Chase nearest edible ghost**  
   *(Only if the ghost is not in ‚Äúeaten‚Äù mode and within chase range)*
2. **Ghost nearby** and **power pellet visible**? ‚Üí **Grab nearest power pellet**  
   *(Tactical use of power pellets to reverse threat)*
3. **Pellets visible** and **no immediate ghost threat**? ‚Üí **Collect closest high-density safe pellet**  
   *(Safe pellets are those PacMan can reach faster than any ghost)*
4. **No safe pellets**? ‚Üí **Retreat to the safest reachable tile**  
   *(Choose tile furthest from all visible ghosts)*
5. **No visible targets at all**? ‚Üí **Explore the least visited tile**  
   *(Encourages full map coverage and uncovering hidden pellets)*

This project implements a grid-based simulation of the classic **Pac-Man** game using the **MARS framework**. Agents such as Pac-Man and the ghosts operate within a grid environment and interact based on simple AI rules. The model is fully visualizable through a separate Python visualization component, allowing real-time monitoring of agent behavior.

## Project Structure

Here's an overview of the structure of the project:

- `Program.cs`: The main entry point that starts the simulation.
- `config.json`: Configures simulation parameters like runtime, visualization, and agent setup. See [Configuration](#configuration).
- `Model/`: Contains all the core logic including agent behavior, game rules, environment setup, and utility classes.
- `Resources/`: Contains initialization files for the grid and agents.
- `Visualization/main.py`: A Python-based visualization tool that connects via WebSocket to render the simulation in real-time.

## Model Description

This simulation includes the following main agent and layer types:

### Agents

- **PacManAgent**: The main agent controlled by logic defined in its `Tick()` method. It can collect pellets, power pellets, and eat ghosts if powered up. The behavior is customizable by adjusting the logic inside `Tick()`.
- **GhostAgent**: Enemies that alternate between chasing and scattering, with specific AI behaviors based on their type (Blinky, Pinky, Inky, Clyde). Ghosts can be eaten only if Pac-Man is powered up.
Each **GhostAgent** has a behavior mode that determines its current strategy. You can check the mode of a ghost using its `Mode` property. The possible modes are:

  - `Chase`: The ghost actively pursues Pac-Man.
  - `Scatter`: The ghost moves to a predefined area on the map and wanders there.
  - `Frightened`: The ghost is vulnerable and can be eaten by Pac-Man (after he eats a power pellet).
  - `Eaten`: The ghost has been eaten and is returning to its home tile to regenerate.
- **Pellet & PowerPellet**: Consumable items that increase the score. Power pellets grant Pac-Man the temporary ability to eat ghosts.

### Layers

- **MazeLayer**: The main layer where all agents interact. It manages the environment grid, agent spawning, and the game loop, including score, collisions, and lives.
- **Environments**: Spatial hash environments that manage agent placement and exploration for Pac-Man and ghosts.

## Pac-Man Behavior Customization

Pac-Man's behavior is defined in the `Tick()` method of `PacManAgent.cs`. This method can be customized to test different strategies. You can control Pac-Man‚Äôs decisions using the following helper methods:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `List<GhostAgent> ExploreGhosts()` | Returns a list of ghost agents near Pac-Man (within visual range). |
| `List<Position> ExploreGhostPositions()` | Returns the positions of nearby ghosts. |
| `List<Position> ExplorePelletPositions()` | Returns the positions of nearby pellets. |
| `List<Position> ExplorePowerPelletPositions()` | Returns the positions of nearby power pellets. |
| `List<Position> ExploreOccupiablePositions()` | Returns all valid and reachable positions Pac-Man can move to. |
| `double GetDistance(Position target)` | Returns the Euclidean distance between Pac-Man and the target position. |
| `int GetScore()` | Returns the current score of the game. |

To move Pac-Man, use:

- `MoveTowardsGoal(Position target)` ‚Äì Moves Pac-Man **one field** toward the target. **Diagonal movement is supported**.

An example logic for prioritizing power pellets, pellets, or running from ghosts is already implemented in the code.

## SmartGhostAgent ‚Äì Customizable Ghost Agent

In addition to the classic **GhostAgent**, this project includes the **SmartGhostAgent**, a programmable variant designed for implementing custom AI behavior. Much like the `PacManAgent`, the `SmartGhostAgent` can be fully controlled via its `Tick()` method, allowing for dynamic and personalized logic. To ensure correct integration with the state and timing mechanisms, the first line of the `Tick()` method should remain `if (ProcessGhostState()) return;`. 

To use `SmartGhostAgents` in the simulation, you must update the `config.json` file to control which agent type is active.  
Only **one** of the two, `GhostAgent` or `SmartGhostAgent`, should have a `count` of `4`, while the other must be set to `0`.


### Behavior and Characteristics
- **Release Timer**: Every ghost, including the `SmartGhostAgent`, has a `ReleaseTick` attribute that defines at which simulation tick the agent is allowed to begin moving, either at game start or after Pac-Man loses a life.

- **Scatter Mode**: While in Scatter mode, the `SmartGhostAgent` has full autonomy over its movement. Unlike classic ghosts, it is not bound to predefined corner targets.

- **Frightened Mode**: When in the Frightened state, the ghost may move freely, but only on **every second tick**, mimicking the slowed behavior from the original game.

- **Eaten Mode**: Once eaten by Pac-Man, the ghost automatically returns to its home tile just like any regular `GhostAgent`.

- **Chase / Scatter Switching**: The `SmartGhostAgent` can switch between Chase and Scatter modes on its own, enabling more coordinated behavior with other ghosts.

- **Limited Vision**: For balancing purposes, the `SmartGhostAgent` has a **smaller visual range** than Pac-Man and can only detect Pac-Man **within its current field of view**. Global tracking of Pac-Man is **not** possible.

### Methods for Custom Logic

The following methods are available to the `SmartGhostAgent` for implementing custom strategies:

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| `PacManAgent? ExplorePacMan()` | Returns the visible `PacManAgent` instance, or `null` if Pac-Man is not in view. |
| `List<GhostAgent> ExploreTeam()` | Returns a list of all teammates. |
| `bool EnterChaseMode()` | Switches the ghost into Chase mode, if currently in Scatter mode. |
| `bool EnterScatterMode()` | Switches the ghost into Scatter mode, if currently in Chase mode. |
| `bool Frightened()` | Returns whether the ghost is currently in the Frightened state. |
| `bool MoveTowardsGoal(Position target)` | Moves the ghost one step toward a target. |
| `List<Position> ExploreOccupiablePositions()` | Returns all reachable positions within the ghost‚Äôs visual range. |
| `double GetDistance(Position target)` | Returns the Euclidean distance to a given position. |
| `Position GetRandomCell()` | Returns a random walkable cell from the map. |
| `List<Position> ExplorePelletPositions()` | Returns positions of all visible pellets. |
| `List<Position> ExplorePowerPelletPositions()` | Returns positions of all visible power pellets. |

For game balance reasons, the `SmartGhostAgent` has a smaller visual range than Pac-Man, since the ghosts act in groups of four.

## Game Logic

- Pac-Man gains:
  - **10 points** for a pellet,
  - **50 points** for a power pellet,
  - **200 points** for eating a ghost (only when powered up).
- Pac-Man has **3 lives**. A life is lost when a ghost catches him while not powered up.
- If Pac-Man loses a life:
  - He and all ghosts are reset to their **starting positions**.
- If all lives are lost, the simulation ends.
- The visibility of Pac-Man is defined by a **visual range** property.

To interact agents must be on the same position after their Tick() action.
This means that Pac-Man and a ghost may pass each other without interacting if they cross paths but do not end up on the same cell. Interactions only occur if they share the same grid cell at the end of the tick.

## Configuration

The simulation is controlled via the `config.json` file:

- `step`: Time steps of the simulation.
- `Visualization`: Set to `true` to enable the Python visualization client.
- `VisualizationTimeout`: Delay between ticks when visualization is active. A **lower number speeds up** the simulation visually.
- `agents` / `layers`: Defines which agents and layers are active and how many agents are spawned.

For more details on configuration, refer to the [MARS documentation](https://mars.haw-hamburg.de/articles/core/model-configuration/index.html).
